A JSON Server application showing the highest probable match results

Printed results are start date, competitors (teams and countries names), venue and highest probability of match result. 
Website contains searchbar which allows to search number of printed results. It can be used by button or by pressing enter

Lauch the code

Install NodeJS     https://nodejs.org/en/

After downloading files, open your folder in a coding program and type npm start in the terminal.

Then open index.html in your browser. I recommend running live server while testing the code


The application has many not finished functions, for example if you search for a strange number in a searchbar (-21545), there would not be any special action or announcement. The code is quite chaotic and could be much simple, that's beacuse I'm still learning stuff.

It's also not responsible for mobile devices. YET.
